SETUP:
- Download the usps dataset from http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data/usps_all.mat
- Build the inference code in the chain folder using the provided Makefile
- Results (in pickled format) and figures (in png, pdf and eps formats) will be
  written at fixed intervals in the ./res/ and ./figs/ folders respectively.
  - Folders should be created before runnning learn_ktsne.py

RUNNING:
- To run ktsne :
python learn_ktsne.py k num_iters perplexity L2 learning_rate number_of_examples_to_use seed

For example: 
python learn_ktsne.py usps 1 250 2 0.5 0.1 1000 1
